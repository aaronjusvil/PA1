# PA1 - Introduction to Python Programming
In this Programming Assignment, we are asked to use and apply the basic functions and codes of python programming in different situations

**1. Alphabet Soup**
**Problem:**
Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order.

**Code Description:**
This code displays how to use the ```sorted()``` and ```.join()``` functions to convert a string into a list of sorted individual elements, and then joined together by a connector, in this case, ```''.join()``` is used so that the output is a string without spaces.

**How to Get Started:**
```
Input: alphabet
Output: aabehlpt
```

**2. Emotify**
**Problem:**
Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad and mad with their corresponding emoticon:

**Code Description:**
This code displays how a function can detect certain words in an inputted string, and replace them with another string using the ```replace()``` function. It shows how strings can be modified with the help of reassigning of variables, without changing the whole string.

**How to Get Started:**
```
Input: I'm so mad
Output: I'm so >:(
```

**3. Unpacking List**
**Problem:** Unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three variables.

**Code Description:**
This code shows how an inputted set of numbers as a string can be split into a list of individual strings using ```.split()```. This code also shows how the if else syntax works, and finally, shows the usefullness of unpacking a list when we try to locate and extract specific variables from a set.

**How to Get Started:**
```
Input: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Output: first:  1 	middle:  ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'] 	last:  10
```
